Just writing a quick blog post to share the fact that putting together the initial site took under an hour! Thanks [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). If you're not already aware, Hugo is a static site generator written in golang. It's quite similar to Jekyll.

It was super simple to run `brew install hugo`, `hugo new site my-website`, find a theme and clone it inside the new site, then run `hugo server -t terminal`. Done!

I'd totally recommend it for those who just want a landing page or even a simple blog, as this is what I'm using it for.

P.S. Naturally, I only committed the change and published the site two years later in 2023.
