Welcome to my personal webpage. From here, you can learn a little about me and find a few different places where I might be active.

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with more than three years of industry experience, following a Masters in Computer Science.

So far I've worked within AWS, working on Amazon S3 (S3 Select and S3 Object Lambda) as well as working within the open source community - specifically with projects that talk to S3 such as Apache Hadoop.
