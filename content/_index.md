Welcome to my personal webpage. From here, you can learn a little about me and find a few different places where I might be active.

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with more than four years of industry experience.

So far I've worked within AWS, working on Amazon S3 (S3 Select and S3 Object Lambda) as well as working within the open source community - specifically with projects that talk to S3 such as Apache Hadoop, as well as launching Amazon's own project [Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/) in Rust.
